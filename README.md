This file contains the introduction of the project.

Bulacan State University - Sarmiento Campus Research Data Bank (BSU-SC Research DB) is a research studies online repository. Certified students, alumni, and professor are the only one who can access this website. Although it is a limited access website, We, the research db team committed our selves for the research to not just be available in the entire campus but also to present it with a bang! ＼\٩( 'ω' )و //／

Yours truly~ The research db team (・㉨・)
